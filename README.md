## Distrobutions
A distribution - short distro - is basically the linux kernel - the core of an os - bundelt with the software necessary to make it usable. 

When picking a distro it important to take your technical knowledge and expertise in account. Some distros are better for beginners than others. 
For example there are some like Ubuntu, Pop_OS, ZorinOS which focus more on beginners. 
And on the other side of the spectrum there are distros like Archlinux, Gentoo and Voidlinux, 
these are for power-users and therefor harder to use and understand.

One thing that I think is also important, is what the distros package manager is and its repositorys.
